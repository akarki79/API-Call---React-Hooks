## INTRODUCTION

This is a repository containing React Hooks code. This is a follow up of a previous code snippet that is written using Class Based Components (https://github.com/akarki79/API-Call---Class-Based-Component).

This snippet should give you an idea about how to convert Class Based components to Functional Components using HOOKS.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. 'useState' and 'useEffect' HOOKS
2. Passing PROPS between components
3. API calls (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using AXIOS
